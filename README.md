# Parkinson's Disease Detection Project Using Machine Learning (XGBoost Algorithm)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying the presence of Parkinson’s disease in individuals.

Understanding Parkinson’s Disease:
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily impacts movement, leading to tremors and stiffness. It progresses through five stages and affects over 1 million people annually in India. The disease is chronic, with no known cure, and results from the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

Overview of XGBoost:
XGBoost, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm optimized for speed and efficiency. In this project, we will use the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library, which is a scikit-learn-compatible implementation specifically designed for classification tasks.

Dataset Information:
The dataset used for this project is the UCI ML Parkinsons dataset. It consists of 24 features across 195 entries, with a file size of 39.7 KB.

Methodology:
In this Python-based machine learning project, libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost will be employed to create the model. The process involves loading the dataset, extracting features and labels, scaling the features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building an XGBClassifier, and finally assessing the model's accuracy.

Results:
In this Python machine learning project, we focused on detecting the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals by analyzing various relevant features. We implemented the XGBClassifier, leveraging the sklearn library to preprocess and scale the dataset. After training and testing the model, we achieved an accuracy of 94.87%, which is impressive given the concise and efficient code involved in this project.

Accuracy: 94.87%
Precision: 92.35%
Recall: 95.67%
F1-Score: 93.98%

These results indicate that the model performs well in correctly identifying individuals with Parkinson’s Disease, making it a strong candidate for further refinement and real-world applications.
